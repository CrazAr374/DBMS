# DBMS Practical Codes

This repository contains practical codes related to Database Management Systems (DBMS) that I have coded and compiled. These codes are designed to help learners understand various DBMS concepts through practical examples.

## Contents
- `Practical1.sql`
- `Practical2a.sql`
- `Practical2b.sql`
- `Practical3.sql`
- `Practical4.sql`
- `Practical5.sql`
- `Practical6.sql`
- `Practical7.sql`

## Upcoming

MongoDB practical codes will be uploaded soon to further enhance learning and provide insights into NoSQL databases.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the SQL files.
3. Use a DBMS tool (like MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, etc.) to execute the SQL codes and explore the functionalities.

Happy Coding!
